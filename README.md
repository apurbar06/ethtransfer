<h1 align="center">Ethereum Transaction App with React Native</h1>

## About
This is a simple React Native application that allows users to send Ethereum transactions to a specific recipient using their private key. The app utilizes the Web3 library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain through the Infura WebSocket node.

3. Update Private Key and Infura Node URL:
   In the `app.tsx` file, replace the `privateKey` variable with your own Ethereum private key. Additionally, if you want to use a different Infura node URL, modify the `web3` instantiation to use your desired URL.

4. Running the App:

   ```
   $ npx react-native run-android
   # or

   ```

## How to Use
1. Address: Enter the recipient's Ethereum address in the "Address" field.
2. Transaction Amount: Enter the amount of Ethereum you want to send in the "Transaction Amount" field.
3. Make Transaction: Click the button to initiate the Ethereum transaction.
4. Transaction Hash: After sending the transaction, the hash will be displayed at the buttom.
5. Transaction Status: The app will show the status of the transaction (pending, success, or failed) once the transaction is processed.
